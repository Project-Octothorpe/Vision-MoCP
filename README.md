In 1980, the Museum of Contemporary Photography established a permanent collection and it is through this collection that the museum has been able to provide an invaluable research and educational resource to the general public and thousands of students. In 2009, the growing collection was digitized and made available online for free to the general public. 

To extend the reach of the Museum of Contemporary Photography’s vast resources from the collection and enhance connections between the institution and the community, we are utilizing user-generated terms to search through the museum’s collection of over 12,000 photographs.


(bold)Hello and thank you for looking into our application! Before you dive in, here is a guide to help you fully understand how everything works:

-The screen will prompt you to ‘get started’. You will then upload a photo of your choice (if you’re on your phone, you can also use your camera to take a new photo!).
-Here is where the magic starts happening; using (link)Google’s Cloud Vision API(link), your photo is analyzed and categorized, down to its essentials. Did you provide a photo of an object in nature? A pet? Yourself? This API will process just what you gave it. The results of this analysis are displayed on the ext page. Pretty neat, huh?
-It only gets neater! From there, those same results from Google Vision are sent to (italic)another(italic) API, (link)Shutterstock(link), to try and find the best corresponding image. You never know what will return!
-Finally, you will be able to put on your own Vision hat and categorize the new image with a hashtag! Feel free to be as abstract or literal as you like. You’re now the artist!
-We then store these hashtags in a (link)Firebase(link)database to keep track of what users are naming images. We then call this information back to the user so they can see what other people have named the image they found. Will they find similarities in how other users analyzed a photo? Complete differences? It’s half the fun!
